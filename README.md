# Unsupervised Learning
This repository contains machine learning notebooks focused on unsupervised learning. Each *script* is a guided Jupyter Notebook that walks through a key stage of the data-science workflow — combining conceptual explanations, analytical exploration, live coding exercises, and sample solutions.
